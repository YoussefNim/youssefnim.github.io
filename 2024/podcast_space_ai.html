    <h1>Intro to Artificial Intelligence (using NotebookLM)</h1>
    <div><i>(en darija, fran√ßais & english)</i></div>
    <main>
      I used NotebookLM for the first time. <br />
      I started by uploading the audio file of our full conversation (which you
      can listen to here) :

      <p>
        <center>
          <iframe
            frameborder="0"
            width="350"
            height="50"
            src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/152TI_OsWVPR8lvu7giElW7m-gS0AXwXx/preview"
          >
          </iframe>
        </center>
      </p>

      <p>And NotebookLM generated 2 pieces of content.</p>
      <h2>First, a 12-minute audio conversation between 2 AI agents.</h2>
      Note : the original conversation was in a mix of French, Moroccan Arabic
      (darija) and English; which means NotebookLM transcribed and translated it
      before generating this output. It's pretty amazing & useful since most
      speech-to-text tools I've tested struggle when the podcast speakers use
      multiple languages at once. <br />
      <p>Here is the AI conversation :) :</p>
      <p>
        <center>
          <iframe
            frameborder="0"
            width="350"
            height="50"
            src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Owg5uAJivpLS1XdeP1gs_awGeNqoiQf/preview"
          >
          </iframe>
        </center>
      </p>

      <h2>Then, NotebookLM generated the following summary in text format :</h2>

      <div class="highlighted-text">
        <p><b>"Briefing Doc: The Future of AI and Its Impact on Society</b></p>

        <p>
          This document summarizes the key themes and insights from a
          transcribed discussion (originally in French and Arabic) about
          artificial intelligence (AI). The conversation primarily revolves
          around the following topics:
        </p>

        <p><b>1. Understanding AI and Machine Learning:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Participants clarify basic AI concepts, such as machine learning,
            deep learning, and algorithms.
          </li>
          <li>
            They emphasize that AI, at its core, is essentially complex
            algorithms processing and transforming information.
          </li>
          <li>
            The discussion delves into the "black box" problem of AI, where the
            inner workings and decision-making processes of complex models can
            be opaque. This raises concerns about control, bias, and potential
            unintended consequences.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Quote:</b> "All this that we call artificial intelligence, isn't it
          just algorithms? Isn't algorithm the equivalent of a system that
          transforms information?"
        </p>

        <p><b>2. Drivers of AI Advancement:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The abundance of data, particularly from social media, is identified
            as a significant catalyst for recent AI progress.
          </li>
          <li>
            Advances in computing power, particularly GPUs, have also played a
            crucial role in enabling the development of more complex models.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Quote:</b> "The social media explosion meant that data was
          everywhere. We no longer had a problem with data. The data was already
          there. We just had to develop algorithms."
        </p>

        <p><b>3. The Impact of AI on Jobs and Skills:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The discussion acknowledges the significant potential for AI to
            automate existing jobs, particularly in sectors with repetitive
            tasks and lower wages.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants emphasize the need for individuals to adapt and develop
            new skills to remain relevant in the evolving job market.
          </li>
          <li>
            The importance of continuous learning and upskilling throughout
            one's career is highlighted.
          </li>
          <li>
            The concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) is briefly discussed as
            a potential solution to address potential mass unemployment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Quote:</b> "I think that artificial intelligence and automation
          will impact many more sectors. It's not just translators, it's also
          architects, journalists...those who just do rewriting or
          low-value-added articles are easily replaceable."
        </p>

        <p><b>4. Addressing the Challenges of AI:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Concerns about AI bias and the potential for it to perpetuate
            existing societal inequalities are raised.
          </li>
          <li>
            The importance of developing AI models that are culturally sensitive
            and representative of diverse perspectives is stressed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Participants debate the ethics of AI development, particularly with
            the "black box" problem, and the need for responsible development
            and deployment.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Quote:</b> "The problem is that all this data comes mainly from the
          Western world and therefore from a Western worldview. So ultimately,
          will AI not also impose a Western worldview on us, particularly that
          of the United States?"
        </p>

        <p><b>5. The Future Potential of AI:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Participants envision a future where AI becomes deeply integrated
            into various aspects of life, transforming industries and creating
            new possibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            They highlight the potential for AI to address global challenges
            such as climate change and resource scarcity.
          </li>
          <li>
            The need for proactive societal adaptation and the importance of
            fostering a positive and informed discourse about AI are emphasized.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          <b>Quote:</b> "The goal is to provide a basic income so that people no
          longer have to worry about food, shelter, and healthcare. They can
          pursue their passions and contribute to society in a way that is
          meaningful to them."
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, the conversation paints a complex picture of AI as a powerful
          tool with the potential to both disrupt and improve society. It
          emphasizes the need for thoughtful consideration of its implications
          and the importance of proactive adaptation on the part of individuals,
          businesses, and governments".
