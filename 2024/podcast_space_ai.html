        <h1> Intro to Artificial Intelligence (using NotebookLM)</h1>
        <div><i>(en darija, fran√ßais & english)</i></div>
<main>

I used NotebookLM for the first time. <br>
I started by uploading the audio file of our full conversation (which you can listen to here) :

<p><center>
<iframe
    frameborder="0"
    width="350"
    height="50"
    src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/152TI_OsWVPR8lvu7giElW7m-gS0AXwXx/preview">
  </iframe>
</center></p>

<p>And NotebookLM generated 2 pieces of content.</p>
<h2> First, a 12-minute audio conversation between 2 AI agents.</h2> 
Note : the original conversation was in a mix of French, Moroccan Arabic (darija) and English; which means NotebookLM transcribed and translated it before generating this output. 
It's pretty amazing & useful since most speech-to-text tools I've tested struggle when the podcast speakers use multiple languages at once. <br>
<p>Here is the AI conversation :) :</p>

    </center></p>
    

<h2>Then, NotebookLM generated the following summary in text format :</h2>

<div class="highlighted-text">
<p><b>"Briefing Doc: The Future of AI and Its Impact on Society</b></p>

<p>This document summarizes the key themes and insights from a transcribed discussion (originally in French and Arabic) about artificial intelligence (AI). The conversation primarily revolves around the following topics:</p>

<p><b>1. Understanding AI and Machine Learning:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Participants clarify basic AI concepts, such as machine learning, deep learning, and algorithms.</li>
    <li>They emphasize that AI, at its core, is essentially complex algorithms processing and transforming information.</li>
    <li>The discussion delves into the "black box" problem of AI, where the inner workings and decision-making processes of complex models can be opaque. This raises concerns about control, bias, and potential unintended consequences.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Quote:</b> "All this that we call artificial intelligence, isn't it just algorithms? Isn't algorithm the equivalent of a system that transforms information?"</p>

<p><b>2. Drivers of AI Advancement:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The abundance of data, particularly from social media, is identified as a significant catalyst for recent AI progress.</li>
    <li>Advances in computing power, particularly GPUs, have also played a crucial role in enabling the development of more complex models.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Quote:</b> "The social media explosion meant that data was everywhere. We no longer had a problem with data. The data was already there. We just had to develop algorithms."</p>

<p><b>3. The Impact of AI on Jobs and Skills:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The discussion acknowledges the significant potential for AI to automate existing jobs, particularly in sectors with repetitive tasks and lower wages.</li>
    <li>Participants emphasize the need for individuals to adapt and develop new skills to remain relevant in the evolving job market.</li>
    <li>The importance of continuous learning and upskilling throughout one's career is highlighted.</li>
    <li>The concept of Universal Basic Income (UBI) is briefly discussed as a potential solution to address potential mass unemployment.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Quote:</b> "I think that artificial intelligence and automation will impact many more sectors. It's not just translators, it's also architects, journalists...those who just do rewriting or low-value-added articles are easily replaceable."</p>

<p><b>4. Addressing the Challenges of AI:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Concerns about AI bias and the potential for it to perpetuate existing societal inequalities are raised.</li>
    <li>The importance of developing AI models that are culturally sensitive and representative of diverse perspectives is stressed.</li>
    <li>Participants debate the ethics of AI development, particularly with the "black box" problem, and the need for responsible development and deployment.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Quote:</b> "The problem is that all this data comes mainly from the Western world and therefore from a Western worldview. So ultimately, will AI not also impose a Western worldview on us, particularly that of the United States?"</p>

<p><b>5. The Future Potential of AI:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Participants envision a future where AI becomes deeply integrated into various aspects of life, transforming industries and creating new possibilities.</li>
    <li>They highlight the potential for AI to address global challenges such as climate change and resource scarcity.</li>
    <li>The need for proactive societal adaptation and the importance of fostering a positive and informed discourse about AI are emphasized.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Quote:</b> "The goal is to provide a basic income so that people no longer have to worry about food, shelter, and healthcare. They can pursue their passions and contribute to society in a way that is meaningful to them."</p>

<p>Overall, the conversation paints a complex picture of AI as a powerful tool with the potential to both disrupt and improve society. It emphasizes the need for thoughtful consideration of its implications and the importance of proactive adaptation on the part of individuals, businesses, and governments".</p>
