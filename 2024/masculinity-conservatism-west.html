      <p>
        Over the past year, there's been a noticeable shift towards traditional
        masculinity and conservatism across the Western world. Instead of a
        random occurrence, this trend reflects deeper economic, cultural, and
        sociological forces shaping modern life.
      </p>

      <p class="highlighted-text">
        <strong>Note:</strong> This article isn't made to promote or endorse any
        particular ideology, but to explore and explain the societal shift
        taking place in the West.
      </p>

      <hr />
      <p>
        Civilizations evolve through cycles of extremes, oscillating like a
        pendulum between opposing ideologies to maintain balance. The ’80s and
        ’90s were marked by globalization, economic booms, and a focus on
        traditional family structures (hyper-financiarization of the economy,
        Wall Street culture ("greed is good"), hypermasculine icons
        -Schwarzenegger- and action movies -Rambo-, relocating production to
        third-world countries with little regard for negative externalities,
        etc...). Masculinity, tied to economic success and societal stability,
        reached its peak during this time. Over the Last Decade, movements like
        gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and
        Inclusion) emerged as a response to the rigid, patriarchal norms
        inherited from the past century. However, when any societal shift moves
        too far in one direction (as the latter arguably did), it inevitably
        provokes a counterreaction to restore some type of balance. In my view,
        today’s rise of masculinity and conservatism is society’s attempt to
        rebalance the scales.
      </p>

      <p>
        The resurgence of masculine values is also tied to the current economic
        climate. In times of uncertainty, stagnation and fear (especially as the
        West faces growing competition from China, Russia, and other Eastern
        powers), societies unconsciously gravitate toward characteristics
        unconsciously associated with masculinity: survival, strength and
        endurance. It might sound ironic but I believe this trend is also
        reflected in the growing popularity of beards, weightlifting and combat
        sports among men. Whether consciously or not, these symbolic gestures
        are ways to get prepared for the perceived tough times ahead. These
        trends also manifest themselves in the cultural appeal of controversial
        politicians (like Trump or Orban) and media figures (like Joe Rogan or
        the Tate brothers) who represent and/or promote self-reliance and
        traditional masculinity.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is also a backlash against what many in the West perceive as the
        imposition of leftist/collectivist policies. Such policies may have been
        more broadly accepted during periods of economic growth. But in the
        post-pandemic era, marked by rising inflation (over 8% on average in
        most western countries in 2023), stagnating growth and rising
        inequality, the "each man on his own" mindset becomes the default
        attitude. The lower your income and the higher the uncertainty about the
        future, the less you are willing to share risks & resources with others.
      </p>

      <p>
        This attitude becomes even more evident as mass immigration becomes a
        major concern. As Western societies become increasingly diverse, studies
        suggest that people are less likely to share resources or risks as a
        group becomes larger and more culturally heterogeneous. This dynamic
        fuels the rise of anti-immigration rhetoric and policies that resonate
        with conservative ideologies, which prioritize national identity,
        cultural cohesion, and masculine strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are also living through exponential economic and societal changes
        driven by technological progress. Many sectors are being disrupted and
        the uncertainties about an AI-dominated future are growing. Social media
        is flooded with information about new technologies that may replace
        humans or render certain roles obsolete (the World Economic Forum
        predicts that 14 million jobs globally could be lost to automation and
        robotization by 2027). So, not only is the pace of change accelerating,
        but we're also witnessing it unfold in real time, which heightens
        anxiety. In this context, conservatism and right-wing ideologies, which
        promise order, security, and a restoration of traditional roles, become
        increasingly reassuring and appealing.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        History has shown us that unchecked swings in either direction, whether
        toward hypermasculinity or extreme progressivism, can destabilize
        societies. The real danger now is the risk of over-correcting: when the
        pendulum swings too far & ends up creating new imbalances. The challenge
        ahead for Western Societies is to navigate this new "masculine" era in a
        balanced way. Without falling into extremist behaviors or worse, a
        regressive ideology that glorifies unchecked machismo and extreme
        individualism, one that excludes marginalized voices and seeks to
        dominate the weak.
