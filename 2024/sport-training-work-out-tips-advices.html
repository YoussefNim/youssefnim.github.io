        <h1>Fitness Tips for Men Over 35: <br> My Personal Journey in Physical Training</h1>
<main>
<p>These fitness tips & lessons come from years of experience in physical training. These advices are mostly useful for beginners. Since it is based on my personal experience, they are especially relevant for men over 35.</p>
<p>These tips are not theoretical. Theyâ€™re based on years of trial and error, countless workouts, and some hard-learned lessons from injuries and setbacks.</p>
<p>But remember, not everything works the same for everyone. Factors like genetics, lifestyle, and goals differ from person to person. So think of these fitness tips as general guidelines to help you explore, experiment and find what works best for your body.
    The journey is personal, but this hard-earned advice will give you a strong start.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Just start. Pick any physical activity you enjoy and get going. The key to consistency is enjoying what you do. The more you like it, the easier it becomes to make it a habit.</li>
    <li>After a while, your body will get used to training and start craving regular exercise. If you're a beginner, progress during this initial phase will be exponential, and that will hopefully keep you motivated.</li>
    <li>At some point, you'll hit a plateau. That's okay if your goal is just to stay healthy. But if you want to build muscle or improve flexibility, you'll need to push yourself harder. There's no free lunch.</li>
    <li>Technology makes everything easier. Whatever you want to do, you'll find free online tutorials. Apps & wearables that guide you and track your progress. Leverage technology.</li>
    <li>Don't use lack of time or equipment as excuses. You can do bodyweight exercises anywhere. Do a quick 10-minute session before your shower. Search "bodyweight exercises" on YouTube if you need ideas.</li>
    <li>"rest mobility" : Stay active throughout the day. If you have a desk job, get up every 30 minutes. Walk around, stretch, get a glass of water or visit a colleague. Find a reason to move.</li>
    <li>Walking often and for at least 30 minutes is one of the best low-impact activities. It's great for improving cardiovascular health and keeps inflammation low.</li>
    <li>Training is only 20% of the equation; nutrition is 80%. If feeling good is not enough for you and you also want to look good, then focus on nutrition.</li>
    <li>Not all advice applies to everyone. For example, many coaches recommend dead hangs to decompress the spine. But they might be risky if you have back problems. Learn what works for your body.</li>
    <li>Don't stick to just one sport. Variety keeps things fun and prevents your body from getting too comfortable. I mix running, calisthenics, and flexibility training to keep things interesting.</li>
    <li>If you're a runner, you must also do strength training to avoid joint and muscle issues.</li>
    <li>For beginners, keep nutrition simple: eat 3 balanced meals a day, avoid snacking. Focus on home-cooked meals and avoid processed foods (anything made in a factory).</li>
    <li>It goes without saying : avoid drugs & alcohol. Alcohol can impede muscle growth, increase fat storage, and lead to poor recovery after training.</li></li>
    <li>Working out also boosts your metabolism and helps you digest faster. Very useful since our base metabolic rate (BMR) tends to slow down as we age.</li>
    <li>You can't choose where to lose fat. It's genetic. Some areas lose fat faster than others.</li>
    <li>Prioritize nasal breathing over mouth breathing whenever possible. Several studies suggest it reduces perceived efforts.</li>
    <li>Fat loss is simple: calories in and calories out. Burn more than you eat and you'll lose fat. Eat more than you burn and you'll gain fat.</li>
    <li>Cardio is a great start for beginners. But after 30, you start losing muscle each year. So resistance training becomes essential to maintain muscle mass.</li>
    <li>The older you get, the harder it becomes to lose deep visceral fat and build muscle. Start now.</li>
    <li>Resistance training means anything that involves pushing, pulling, or lifting. You don't need fancy machines or equipment : Bodyweight exercises, light dumbbells or resistance bands all work. These are not expensive.</li>
    <li>You don't need machines. Bodyweight exercises or simple tools like elastic bands, dumbbells, or kettlebells are enough.</li>
    <li>Fasting is underrated. It helps your cells regenerate and makes you more alert. Try skipping 1-3 meals per week. You woke up late? Skip breakfast. Tired & sleepy in the evening ? skip dinner.</li>
    <li>Working out on an empty stomach (fasted cardio for example) increases fat oxydation by circa 20%.</li>
    <li>Eat a balanced diet. Focus on meat, vegetables, fruits, and fish. Include eggs for protein.</li>
    <li>It is incredibly difficult to build muscles in the lower body. And most men tend to focus on their upper body. but do not neglect legs training! Several studies show that legs training increases the production of testosterone & human growth hormon (HGH) more than other exercises. </li>
    <li>Sprinting (on a flat surface or ideally on a hill) is an underrated way of working the legs muscles. Try interval sprinting (10 seconds sprinting, 30 seconds walking, repeat until exhaustion).</li>
    <li>Several coaches recommend regular cold showers. It is an unnatural way to increase dopamine release. Cold showers are mostly useful post-workout since they decrease muscle soreness.</li>
    <li>What works best for me are showers with lukewarm water (Not too hot, not too cold). Test and see what helps you recover faster.</li>
    <li>Have a warm drink first thing in the morning. Warm coffee, tea or even water. It stimulates digestion and blood digestion and signal to your organs that they have to wake up. Avoid cold drinks in the morning (juice, soda, milshake).</li>
    <li>Do a blood test before starting supplements. Only take what your body truly needs. Don't rely on protein powders or creatine unless you're training regularly.</li>
    <li>Whenever possible, get your nutrients naturally instead of taking supplements. Need Vitamin D ? Get more sun exposure. Need protein ? Eat more eggs, lean meat & spiruline.</li>
    <li>High stress levels raise cortisol which makes it harder to lose fat and can increase inflammation. Try meditation, yoga or whatever works best for you. But you need to face this issue.</li>
    <li>Whether doing bodyweight or weightlifting exercises, focus on full range of motion (ROM) with proper form. 5 perfect push-ups (perfect arms movement, squeezed core, aligned body) are better than 10 sloppy ones. Quality over quantity.</li>
    <li>If you're short on time, try HIIT (high intensity interval training). Some studies show that 7-10 minutes of intense exercise can improve cardiovascular health similarly to a 30-minute moderate session.</li>
    <li>Underrated : Rest if you're tired. Don't force it. Listen to your body. Overtraining increases inflammation and can slow down recovery.</li>
    <li>Prioritize compound movements : they engage multiple muscle groups at once. They burn more calories and build functional strength. Compound exercises can burn up to 50% more calories than isolation exercises (1 movement to train only 1 muscle).</li>
    <li>Some muscles are rarely activated in our daily lives or during work-outs. Add lateral & rotational movements. Walk or run backwards.</li>
    <li>Find inspiration in nature and history : by doing what our ancestors used to do, what worked for thousands of years, you can't get wrong. Lifting or jumping over objects, eating veggies and meat, sprinting or climbing, are things that humans have been doing for ages.</li>
    <li>Underrated : Good sleep is essential. Muscles repair and grow when you sleep. Aim for 7-8 hours per night.</li>
    <li>There is no universally recognized better time of day to work out. Listen to your body and do whatever helps you keep a consistent training schedule.</li>
    <li>We all have a strong & weak side. It's normal. At some point, you will probably feel muscles imbalance. Just train you weak side slightly harder (unilateral movements). </li>
    <li>Underrated :  Warming up (before training) and cooling down (after training) will help you avoid unnecessary injuries and keep the muscles flexible.</li>
    <li>For warm-ups, do dynamic movements. For cooling down, do stretching. Never do stretching BEFORE training.</li>
    <li>Don't hurry it up. Take your time. 10 minutes to warm-up and 10 minutes to cool down. In the long term, your body will feel the effects.</li>
    <li>Work on your grip strength: Grip strength is one of the best indicators of overall strength and longevity. Studies show that poor grip strength is correlated with a higher risk of heart disease and reduced life expectancy. Work on grip through exercises like dead hangs or farmer's walks.</li>
    <li>Itâ€™s a journey. Over time, you'll realize it's not only the physical workouts that matter. It's also about nutrition and breathing. About self-discovery and mental discipline.</li>
    <li>It's never too late to start. The best time to begin is now.</li>
